# Workout Tracker
Introducing "Workout Trackers" â€“ a SwiftUI app crafted as a personal exploration into the intricate relationship between SwiftUI and Core Data. Created with my developer's curiosity, this project serves as a live test bed for understanding and implementing the nuances of these technologies.

The initial phase involves setting up fundamental functionalities in alignment with Apple's recommended practices. Subsequent iterations delve deep into refining the Core Data implementation, documenting both successes and pitfalls. Throughout this process, I take meticulous notes, capturing insights into challenges faced and optimizations made.

While Swift Data is a promising addition, currently limited to iOS 17, I recognize the significance of Core Data in the iOS ecosystem. I anticipate the gradual integration of Swift Data into mainstream development in the coming 1 or 2 years, and my focus remains on aligning with Apple's evolving landscape.

For fellow developers, expect a companion YouTube series where I share my learnings, discoveries, and interesting aspects encountered during the app's creation. Beyond being a workout tracking tool, this project aims to contribute to the developer community's understanding of SwiftUI and Core Data intricacies.

The app's simplicity in the initial release serves as a deliberate choice, laying the groundwork for future features and advanced techniques. Think of "Workout Trackers" as my personal sandbox, evolving with ongoing updates as I experiment with new technologies and methodologies.

Feel free to dive into the codebase, explore the commit history, and join me in this candid exploration of SwiftUI and Core Data, where development insights take center stage.
